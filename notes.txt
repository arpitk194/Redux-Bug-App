3 parts of Redux

i) Action - Object which tells what changed in store
ii) Reducer - Pure function that updates the store (Immutable)
ii) Store - Single source of truth object which holds the data

On an event which should update Store, we Dispatch Action object to store which inturn calls
Reducer to update the respective slice. (action -> store -> reducer)
